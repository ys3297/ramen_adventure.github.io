## Top 10 lists
First, let's have a look on the top 10 ramens for each year from 2012-2016!

### 2016

```{r, echo=FALSE}
top_ten_2016 = 
  tidy_ramen %>% 
  filter(year == 2016) %>% 
  arrange(rank) %>% 
  select(rank, brand, variety, style, country) %>% 
  kable()

top_ten_2016
```

### 2015

```{r, echo=FALSE}
top_ten_2015 = 
  tidy_ramen %>% 
  filter(year == 2015) %>% 
  arrange(rank) %>% 
  select(rank, brand, variety, style, country) %>% 
  kable()

top_ten_2015
```

### 2014

```{r, echo=FALSE}
top_ten_2014 = 
  tidy_ramen %>% 
  filter(year == 2014) %>% 
  arrange(rank) %>% 
  select(rank, brand, variety, style, country) %>% 
  kable()

top_ten_2014
```

### 2013

```{r, echo=FALSE}
top_ten_2013 = 
  tidy_ramen %>% 
  filter(year == 2013) %>% 
  arrange(rank) %>% 
  select(rank, brand, variety, style, country) %>% 
  kable()

top_ten_2013
```

### 2012
```{r, echo=FALSE}
top_ten_2012 = 
  tidy_ramen %>% 
  filter(year == 2012) %>% 
  arrange(rank) %>% 
  select(rank, brand, variety, style, country) %>% 
  kable()

top_ten_2012
```

Of course, you can find that all the lists above are not complete. The reason might be Alexsey didn't complete the data entry. However, after checking the original [Top 10 lists](https://www.theramenrater.com/top-ten-lists/) and comparing them with what we have in the dataset, we found that only one year and rank could be recorded for those ramens which were listed for multiple times in the top 10 lists for different years in the raw dataset.  
Anyway, we could only use this page for practice purpose. If you really want to know the complete top 10 lists, you can go directly to [The Ramen Rater](https://www.theramenrater.com/) and find more complete and updated information.

## By country

Next, let's see the number of top 10 ramen varieties produced by each country.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
top_country_bar = 
  tidy_ramen %>% 
  drop_na(rank) %>% 
  count(country) %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = n, fill = country)) +
    geom_col() +
    geom_text(
      aes(label = n),
      nudge_y = 0.125
    ) + 
    labs(
      title = "Number of top 10 ramen varieties produced by each country",
      y = "Number of top 10 ramen varieties",
      x = "Country"
    )

top_country_bar
```

We can see that Singapore was the country that had the most top 10 ramen varieties (`r tidy_ramen %>% drop_na(rank) %>% filter(country == "Singapore") %>% nrow()`), followed by Japan (`r tidy_ramen %>% drop_na(rank) %>% filter(country == "Japan") %>% nrow()`) and Malaysia (`r tidy_ramen %>% drop_na(rank) %>% filter(country == "Malaysia") %>% nrow()`).

## By brand

Finally, let's see the number of top 10 ramen varieties produced by each brand.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
top_brand_bar = 
  tidy_ramen %>% 
  drop_na(rank) %>% 
  count(brand) %>% 
  mutate(brand = fct_reorder(brand, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = brand, y = n, fill = brand)) +
    geom_col() +
    geom_text(
      aes(label = n),
      nudge_y = 0.125
    ) + 
    labs(
      title = "Number of top 10 ramen varieties produced by each brand",
      y = "Number of top 10 ramen varieties",
      x = "Brand"
    ) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))

top_brand_bar
```

We can see that Prima Taste was the brand that had the most top 10 ramen varieties (`r tidy_ramen %>% drop_na(rank) %>% filter(brand == "Prima Taste") %>% nrow()`), followed by Indomie (`r tidy_ramen %>% drop_na(rank) %>% filter(brand == "Indomie") %>% nrow()`), Mama (`r tidy_ramen %>% drop_na(rank) %>% filter(brand == "Mama") %>% nrow()`), MyKuali (`r tidy_ramen %>% drop_na(rank) %>% filter(brand == "MyKuali") %>% nrow()`), and Nongshim (`r tidy_ramen %>% drop_na(rank) %>% filter(brand == "Nongshim") %>% nrow()`).

## Conclusion

From the tables and graphs above, we can see that:  
<ul>
<li>Singapore was really good at producing instant noodles (Prima Taste is also a Singapore brand);</li>
<li> **OR**, Hans Lienesch, the ramen rater, had a strong preference for instant noodles with Singapore, or more general, Southeast Asia taste from 2012 to 2016.</li>
</ul>
Anyway, if you have the same preference, you can use the information above or the original [Top 10 lists](https://www.theramenrater.com/top-ten-lists/) for reference when purchasing instant noodles.
