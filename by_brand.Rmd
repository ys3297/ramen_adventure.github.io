## Background Introduction 
In this Ramen dataset, there are `r nrow(count(tidy_ramen, brand))` brands. In the following adventure, let's explore the varieties and rating of these brands!

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
five_stars =
  tidy_ramen %>%
  select(brand, stars) %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  filter(stars == 5)

zero_stars =
  tidy_ramen %>%
  select(brand, stars) %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  filter(stars == 0)
```

Among all brands in the dataset, `r nrow(count(five_stars, brand)) ` brands have at least one ramen variety that was rated 5 stars, while `r nrow(count(zero_stars, brand)) ` brands have at least one ramen variety that was rated 0 stars.

## 5 Brands with Most Rated Varieties

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
most_various = 
  tidy_ramen %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarize(num_varieties = n()) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  mutate(brand = fct_reorder(brand, num_varieties))

most_various_plot =
  most_various %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Brand: ", brand, "\nNumber of varieties: ", num_varieties)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~brand, y = ~num_varieties, color = ~brand, type = "bar", 
          text = ~text_label,
          marker = list(color = 'viridis', 
                        line = list(color = 'white', width = 1.5))) %>% 
  layout(title = "5 Ramen Brands with Most Rated Varieties",
         xaxis = list(title = "Brand"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Varieties")) 

most_various_plot
```

As shown in the above plot, *Nissin* is the winner with `r tidy_ramen %>% filter(brand == 'Nissin') %>% summarize(count = n())` ramen varieties rated. The second to fifth brands are *Nongshim*, *Maruchan*, *Mama*, and *Paldo*. Each of them has about 60 to 100 ramen varieties rated.

### Distribution of Rating Stars

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
distri_various = 
  tidy_ramen %>%
  drop_na(stars) %>%
  filter(brand %in% c("Paldo", "Mama", "Maruchan", "Nongshim", "Nissin")) %>%
  mutate(brand = forcats::fct_relevel(brand, c("Paldo", "Mama", "Maruchan", "Nongshim", "Nissin"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = brand, y = stars, color = brand)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Rating Distribution Plot of the 5 Brands with Most Rated Varieties",
    x = "Brand",
    y = "Rating Stars (0-5)"
  )

distri_various
```

The above box plots show that the median rating stars of *Nissin*, *Nongshim*, and *Paldo* are close to 4 stars. The median of  *Mama* and *Maruchan* are lower than 4 stars. More than 75% of products of these 5 brands were rated above or equal to 3 stars.

Only *Paldo* and *Maruchan* have some ramen products that were rated as 0 stars.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
five_stars_various = 
  tidy_ramen %>%
  drop_na(stars) %>%
  filter(brand %in% c("Paldo", "Mama", "Maruchan", "Nongshim", "Nissin"),
         stars == 5) %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarize(num_five = n())

num_five_various = 
  full_join(
    most_various, five_stars_various, by = c("brand")
  ) %>%
  mutate(prct = num_five / num_varieties * 100)

prct_plot = 
  num_five_various %>%
  mutate(brand = fct_reorder(brand, prct)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = brand, y = prct, fill = brand)) + 
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = round(prct, 2)),
    nudge_y = 0.5
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of 5-Star Ramen among the 5 Brands with Most Rated Varieties",
    x = "Brand",
    y = "Percentage of 5 Stars (%)"
  )

prct_plot
```

All of these 5 brands have at least one ramen variety that was rated as 5 stars. *Paldo* has the highest percentage of ramen varieties rated as 5 stars, while *Maruchan* has the lowest percentage of ramen varieties rated as 5 stars.

## Conclusion

In this dataset, *Nissin*, *Nongshim*, *Maruchan*, *Mama*, and *Paldo* are the 5 brands with the largest number of varieties rated. The medians of stars for these 5 brands are higher than 3 stars. *Paldo* has the highest percentage of ramen varieties rated as 5 stars.
