### Motivation
All members of the group are noodles lovers and want to look for the best instant noodles to purchase as well as the worst instant noodles to avoid purchasing in the future. Then we found an amazing dataset about ramen ratings in Kaggle, so we decided to use it as a reference to answer our questions.  

### Questions
Primarily, we just wanted to know what are the best and worst instant noodles according to the dataset. This was answered by the ratings of the instant noodles that the rater had tried as well as the top 10 lists of each year from 2012 to 2016.  
After we looked further into the dataset, we thought it would also be interesting if we explore more about the overall rating distribution for each country and brand, and which country/brand produced the greatest number of 0-star/5-star/top 10 ramens.  

### Data
The dataset was republished according to [The Ramen Rater](https://www.theramenrater.com/) by Aleksey Bilogur. It can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/ramen-ratings)  
[The Ramen Rater](https://www.theramenrater.com/) is a website on which Hans Lienesch posted his reviews of instant noodles.  
Each record in the raw dataset is a single ramen product review. Review numbers are contiguous: more recently reviewed ramen varieties have higher numbers. Brand, Variety (the product name), Country, and Style (Cup? Bowl? Tray?) are pretty self-explanatory. Stars indicate the ramen quality, as assessed by the reviewer, on a 5-point scale. The raw dataset also includes a "Top Ten" column to show the rank and rated year of each top 10 ramen.
