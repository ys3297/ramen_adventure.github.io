P8105: Final Project Proposal
================

### The group members (names and UNIs):

Simin Ling (sl4658), Yi Sun (ys3297), Yiting Li (yl4362), Hanran Wei
(hw2765)

### The tentative project title:

Ramen Adventure

### The motivation for this project:

We are all ramen lovers and would love to know which brand/variety of
ramen has the lowest grade (and will never consider purchasing the them
in the future\!).

### The intended final products:

We plan to create a website with the worst 10 ramens with their origin
country, brand, variety, and review stars; as well as distribution maps
of stars by country and brand.

### The anticipated data sources:

<https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/ramen-ratings> from Aleksey
Bilogur  
Each record in the dataset is a single ramen product review. Review
numbers are contiguous: more recently reviewed ramen varieties have
higher numbers. Brand, Variety (the product name), Country, and Style
(Cup? Bowl? Tray?) are pretty self-explanatory. Stars indicate the ramen
quality, as assessed by the reviewer, on a 5-point scale.

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:

Bar plot for the worst 10 ramens on their stars  
Box plots for distribution maps of stars by country and brand

### The planned timeline:

Nov. 14 - 19: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
Nov. 20 - 27: Build website  
Nov. 28: Finalize website
